        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a typical dish from Puerto Rico. Arroz con gandules is a great recipe for the holidays, but can be enjoyed
           year round. It contains a ton of flavor that can be enjoyed by everyone.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Cups Medium-grain rice</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Tomato Paste</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon or ham, optional</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oil, vegetable oil, olive oil, or achiote oil</li>
            <li>1 Cup Canned Gandules</li>
            <li>½ cup green olives</li>
            <li>¼ cup sofrito, thawed if using store bought frozen sofrito</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp Adobo Seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>3.5 cups Water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large heavy bottomed pot like a dutch oven, or a caldero if you have one, 
                over medium heat. If using ham or bacon, slowly cook the meat until crispy, remove
                meat from pot and set aside leaving the drippings. If not using meat, add oil before
                continuing with the next step.</li>
            <li>Add the gandules, tomato sauce, green olives, sofrito, salt, adobo seasoning, sazon, ground black pepper and ground cumin. Stir to fully combine.</li>
            <li>Once the mixture becomes fragrant, pour in the water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil and then add the rice. Stir until rice is submerged and pigeon peas are distributed evenly.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for about 25 minutes. You can add your ham or bacon back in now if you want, or wait to add it in again before serving. Traditionally the rice would be covered with a banana or plantain leaf. However, a tight fitting pot lid will work just fine!</li>
            <li>About half way through cooking, remove the lid and stir by folding rice from the bottom up, but do not disturb the rice at the bottom of pan. (This is a very touchy subject – some Puerto Ricans insist that you don't stir the rice while cooking to get the best pegao, crispy rice bottom. However, I find stirring it once cooks everything more evenly. Whatever you do, make sure you only stir it once or the rice will become sticky/mushy.)</li>
            <li>After simmering for 25 minutes, remove the arroz con gandules from the heat and let it sit for an additional 10 minutes before serving. This is called letting the rice "steam".  The rice is done once all the liquid is absorbed.</li>
            <li>After letting the rice rest for about a half hour, remove the lid. Fluff and stir the rice, then serve warm!</li>
        </ol>
